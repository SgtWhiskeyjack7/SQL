#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1.How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(*) from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderID)= 6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
select count(product) from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product= 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum 
    from BIT_DB.customers 
    inner join BIT_DB.FebSales
    ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id = BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
    where length(orderID) = 6
    and orderid <> 'Order ID';
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?    
select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where  price in (select min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
Group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
